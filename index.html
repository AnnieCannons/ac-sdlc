        <h2>Big Picture</h2>
        <p>SDLC should result in a high quality system that: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">meets or exceeds customer expectations</li>
            <li class="fragment">reaches completion within time and cost estimates </li>
            <li class="fragment">works effectively and efficiently in the current and planned IT infrastructure </li>

    <section>
        <h2>SDLC Methods</h2>
        <p>There are many different ways for a company to set up their SDLC. A lot of it depends on the kind of company it is, the type of product (or website) they are making, and the complexity or the number of people working on the product.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Two main categories: agile ("adaptive") and waterfall ("predictive") methods. </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Agile</h2>
        <p>Agile methodologies generally promote a project management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, and self-organization and accountability</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Individuals and interactions over processes and tools </li>
            <li class="fragment">Working software over comprehensive documentation </li>
            <li class="fragment">Customer collaboration over contract negotiation </li>
            <li class="fragment">Responding to change over following a plan </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>Agile: Sprints</h2>
        <p>Sprints: a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.</p>
        <p>The duration of a sprint is determined by the scrum master, the team's facilitator. Once the team reaches a consensus for how many days a sprint should last, all future sprints should be the same. Traditionally, a sprint can last from one week to 30 days.</p>

        <h2>Waterfall</h2>
        <p>The waterfall model shows a process, where developers are to follow these steps in order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="fragment">Requirements specification (AKA Verification or Analysis) </li>
            <li class="fragment">Design </li>
            <li class="fragment">Construction (AKA implementation or coding) </li>
            <li class="fragment">Integration </li>
            <li class="fragment">Testing and debugging (AKA validation) </li>
            <li class="fragment">Installation (AKA deployment) </li>
            <li class="fragment">Maintenance </li>

        <h2>User Experience (UX) Design</h2>
        <p>“All the expectations, all the questions, all the needs and all the ways of thinking in the users mind is like a baseball glove, the solution we come up with is like the baseball, that fits snuggly, right into that glove” (Ryan Singer).</p>
        <p> In other words we, as designers, do all the thinking up front, so that when a user comes to our finished project, they don’t even have to think about anything, it just makes complete sense to them.</p>

        <p>SQA is the overarching and systematic process under which a customer specified product or service is created.</p>
        <p class="fragment">SQA organizes, monitors, improves and audits the product or service during every step of the software development lifecycle focusing on the prevention of problems that software development is prone to create. </p>

        <h2>What is Software Testing?</h2>
        <p>Software testing describes a series or set of planned activities, under controlled conditions, which are intentionally designed and executed to uncover failures of the product or service being developed. </p>
        <p class="fragment">Errors and bugs are brought to light with testing, and any resulting failures are recorded, detailed and forwarded back to the development team for additional review and/or repair. </p>

           <li class="fragment"><span style="color:orange">Where the software has BUGS</span> (where does the software stop running? What parts of it don’t do what they’re supposed to?)</li>
           <li class="fragment"><span style="color:orange">Does it still work for everyone </span> (if you click in an unusual place, does it still work as intended?)</li>

       <h2>Why does software have bugs?</h2>
       <ol>
           <li class="fragment">Lack of and/or poor communication between the customer and developer</li>
           <li class="fragment">A natural result of human factors, trying to mix human nature with logical programming, compounded by the fact that multiple humans were involved in writing the code</li>
           <li class="fragment">The gluing together of many small fragments (units) of code into one large and unwieldy program</li>

       <p>It’s not about finding WHETHER the software has defects - all software does. </p>
       <p>It’s about finding <span style="color:yellow">how many bugs or defects or oversights exist and where they are</span>.</p>

           <li class="fragment">A comparison of the actual results to the expected results in the test plan.</li>

       <ul style="font-size:25px">
            <li class="fragment"> <span style="color:red;">P0:</span> this problem makes the product useless or makes it fail its essential function.  It should be fixed ASAP and before all others.</li>
            <li class="fragment"> <span style="color:red;">P1:</span> this problem seriously affects the product’s usability and needs to be fixed as soon as P0s are fixed.</li>
            <li class="fragment"> <span style="color:red;">P2:</span> this problem results in a noticeably poor user experience. It’s still a high-priority fix.</li>
            <li class="fragment"> <span style="color:red;">P3:</span> this problem degrades the user experience in ways that are not obvious to every user, or effects only a small portion of users noticeably.</li>
            <li class="fragment"> <span style="color:red;">P4:</span> this problem results in a noticeably poor user experience (but not uselessness) for only some users or some cases. It’s still a high-priority fix.</li>
            <li class="fragment"> <span style="color:red;">P5:</span> this problem would be nice to fix but isn’t mission-critical.</li>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p style="color:yellow">What is the most important process in a life cycle of a product and why?</p>
        <p class="fragment">The most important part of the life cycle is the requirement stage. The majority of bugs can be found in bad requirements and thus will save the company you work for millions of dollars. Bad requirements can cause confusion between teams and can create chaos at the workplace.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p style="color:yellow">Why would you log a defect?</p>
        <p class="fragment">It is the job of a tester to find bugs. If bugs are not logged, then there would be no record of the bug found and it would not get fixed. These errors would remain in the code when the customer received the product.</p>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p style="color:yellow">What are metrics?</p>
        <p class="fragment">A metric is a standard of measurement. Software metrics are the statistics describing the structure or content of a program. A metric should be a real objective measurement of something such as number of bugs per lines of code.</p>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p style="color:yellow">What are requirements?</p>
        <p class="fragment">A requirement is a guideline to what the program or product is supposed to do. Good requirement need to be clear, concise and unambiguous because there may be a large group of people that will read the requirement. A requirement also needs to be verifiable, feasible, necessary and complete.</p>
